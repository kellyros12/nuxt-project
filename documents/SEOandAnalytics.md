Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is how to get search engines to rank your website higher than others. Some search engines (such as Google) often change their algorithm for SEO. According to Rand Fiskin, the foundation of a good SEO begins with Crawl accessibility and moves up from there.

SEO is the practice of increasing both the quality and quantity of website traffic through organic (non-paid) search engine results. SEO is important since it will help deliver better information to search engines. This information helps drive the majority of online traffic through the organic search results. Organic search results are more likely to be clicked over paid ads. Analytics are a way for developers to know what content is seen the most and least by users.


SEO Implementation:

While my project is fairly simple, I think that is a little more straight to the point when compared with movie database websites such as IMDB. One way to improve SEO, is to create a robots.txt file. A robots.txt file tells crawlers how to view your webpage. Best practices for the robots.txt file is to not block any content or sections of your website. I can also configure the SEO using the the head method in my pages.
